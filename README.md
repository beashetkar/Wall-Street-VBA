# Wall-Street-VBA

### Background

In this assignment I use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. I have chosen the Hard challenge. 

### Files

Test Data - Use this while developing your scripts.
Stock Data - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Stock market analysis

PART 1
Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

PART II

Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

PART III

Your solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and
"Greatest total volume".

CHALLENGE

Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
